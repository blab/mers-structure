# MERS-CoV dynamics in camels and sporadic clusters in humans
Looking into MERS-CoV dynamics through the structured coalescent lens.

------------------------------
# Questions:
- What is the *actual* number of introductions of MERS-CoV into humans? Literature knows the number >1, but nothing more precise reported.
- What can be estimated about an epidemic from sequence data and structure? A spin off of Zika in Florida work.
- What is the rate of coinfection in camels? A consistent mutation-scaled recombination rate could be rescaled into absolute time to give a recombination rate in time.
------------------------------
# TODO (Spanish for "all"):
- ~~MTT trees after splitting the alignment into two fragments is done.~~ Good indications topologies are very similar between the two fragments.
- ~~Single MTT tree done.~~ Human-to-camel transmission was impossible to prevent, but data is strongly informative of camel-dominated evolution of MERS.
- ~~Regular BEAST skygrid on 92 camel sequences done.~~
- ~~R0 analyses somewhat complete.~~ Show R0<1.0, which makes sense. Waiting for additional analyses from Luiz.
- Seasonality. There's an apparent relationship between end cluster size and introduction time - largest clusters switched hosts in January-February.
------------------------------
# Figures
### Main:
- Typed node tree. Shows evolution primarily occurring in camels.
- Exploded tree. Show the distribution of cluster sizes, their introduction time density. Camel skygrid too?
- R0. Shows value <1.0, similar to other publications based on case clusters.


### Supplementary:
- Plot showing good support for consistent inference of human clusters across genomic fragment trees. Heatmap/composite plots.
- Posterior densities for camel and human deme effective population sizes?
- Posterior counts for introductions into humans.
- Anything related to R0.
