# MERS-CoV dynamics in camels and sporadic clusters in humans
Looking into MERS-CoV dynamics through the structured coalescent lens.

------------------------------
# TODO (Spanish for "all"):
- Run MTT trees with whole genomes, preventing humans from infecting camels.
- Run MTT trees with whole genomes, allowing humans to infect camels.
- Run MTT trees with fragmented genomes, with shared deme sizes.
- Run BEAST on camel sequences to get a skygrid.
- SIR simulations to look into R_0 and its variance?


Current problems:
- Hard constraint on no back-transmission into camels makes MTT trees go crazy. Trying to introduce relatively strong priors to correct this.

------------------------------

# Figures
Main:
- Distribution of cluster sizes, will give an idea of R_0.
- Skygrid of camel MERS-CoVs, will give an idea of what's going on in camels.
- Correlation between MERS pop sizes in camels versus introductions into humans.
- Correlation between MERS cases and MERS sequences, binned in time.
- Clade frequencies of each MERS cluster over time.


Supplementary:
- Tree with heatmap, showing the absence of a large number of synapomorphic loci supporting the maximum likelihood, or any other phylogeny.
- Heatmap of clade membership for human cases, should (the 'theoretically' should, not 'make it so' should) show that recombination does not affect human cluster inference.
